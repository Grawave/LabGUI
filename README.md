# LabGUI

This is a home assignment for a job interview.

This program does not have actual functionality. It is in some cases simulated with arbitrary values as input data etc.

The GUI has capability to take inputs and monitor output of the lab system (arbitrary data here).

Inputs are taken for Pump1 (flowrate, duration) and Pump2 (flowrate, duration). Output is read for Pump1 flow rate, Pump2 flow rate and temperature. These characteristics are dislayed real time to the user.
